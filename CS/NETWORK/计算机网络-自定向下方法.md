## 1.1 什么是因特网
回答问题的两种方：
1.描述因特网的具体构成：构成因特网的基本硬件和软件组件
2.根据分布式应用提供服务的联网设施来描述因特网

下面从`1.描述因特网的具体构成`开始
### 1.1.1 具体构成描述
分为：`host` and `end system`
`End systems` are connected together by a network of **communication links(通信链路)** and **packet switches（分组交换机）**.
**communication links(通信链路)**：是由不同的物理媒体构成（同轴电缆，铜线，光纤，无线电频谱）

Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate（传输速率）** of a link measured in bits/second.

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and **adds header** bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

A `packet switch` takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. 
`Packet switches` come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types intoday’s Internet are **routers(路由器)** and **link-layer switches（链路层交换机）**.

Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. 朝着最终目的地转发分组

Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks
while routers are typically used in the network core. 



The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from
the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path
through the network. The exact amount of traffic being carried in the Internet is
difficult to estimate but Cisco [Cisco VNI 2011] estimates global Internet traffic will be nearly 40 exabytes per month in 2012.
